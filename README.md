# Capstone project
An app and website for my capstone project for my undergraduate degree in computer science

## Technologies and concepts used:
This uses Spring Boot 3+, Java 17, Spring Security 6+, WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP), SQLite, and as of the end of the capstone android, with eventually creating the iOS verision prior to publishing. As his uses WAMP, it follows the implementation a persistent storage structure with CRUD. It has the typical software design MVC (Model View Controller) commonly used for developing user interfaces. Additionally, with Java, it follows the OOP model to software design, creating POJO (plain old java object) or "beans" as DTOs, then to have business logic there are various services, along with DAOs and controllers. It parses JSON to access the information of the concerns based on the search queries. I started this project by following an Agile approach of extreme programming (XP), with behavior driven design and using the given-when-then test structure to help guide me in thinking about fringe cases, and the end user.

## Success For All
The objective of this orginally as my capstone project is to develop a user-friendly mobile and web application (app) for families and educators with comprehensive information on child development, disabilities, the identification process and a means to connect to local assistance. Currently, there is popularity in smartphone applications usage with convenience and access particularly among the target audience is millennials and generation Z). Thus this provides a modern solution to  bridge the knowledge gap in education for a child or children by the user.
