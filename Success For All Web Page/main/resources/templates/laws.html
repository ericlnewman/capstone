                <h2>Laws</h2>
              
                    <h2>Special Education Federal Laws</h2>
						<p>Special education in the United States is governed by several federal laws aimed at ensuring that students with disabilities receive appropriate educational services. These laws, along with individual state laws, provide legal protections and guidelines for the identification, evaluation, and provision of special education and related services to eligible students. Here are some key federal laws related to special education:</p>
						<h3>1. Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</h3>
						<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuals_with_Disabilities_Education_Act" target="_blank">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</a> is the main federal law governing special education. It ensures that children with disabilities have access to a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) and receive special education services tailored to their individual needs. IDEA outlines the rights of students with disabilities and their families and mandates the provision of an individualized education program (IEP) for each eligible student.</p>
						<h3>2. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act</h3>
						<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_504_of_the_Rehabilitation_Act" target="_blank">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act</a> prohibits discrimination based on disability in programs receiving federal financial assistance. It provides protections and reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities who may not qualify for special education under IDEA but still require supports and modifications to fully participate in educational programs and activities.</p>
						<h3>3. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h3>
						<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990" target="_blank">The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a> is a comprehensive civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in various domains, including education. ADA ensures equal access and nondiscrimination in public schools, colleges, and universities. It mandates reasonable accommodations and modifications to ensure students with disabilities can fully participate in educational programs and activities.</p>
						<h3>4. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</h3>
						<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act" target="_blank">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</a> protects the privacy of students' educational records. It grants parents and eligible students (18 years or older) the right to access and control the release of their education records, including special education records. FERPA also sets guidelines for the confidentiality of students' personally identifiable information.</p>
						<h3>5. Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)</h3>
						<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_and_Secondary_Education_Act" target="_blank">Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)</a>, currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), addresses various aspects of elementary and secondary education, including provisions for students with disabilities. ESSA emphasizes educational equity, accountability, and the inclusion of students with disabilities in state accountability systems.</p>
						<h3>5. No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act</h3>
						<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act" target="_blank">No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act</a> was a federal education law enacted in 2001 with the goal of improving educational outcomes for all students. NCLB emphasized standards-based education reform, increased accountability for schools and districts, and targeted resources to low-income schools. It required annual standardized testing in reading and math for students in grades 3-8, as well as high school.</p>
						<p>Under NCLB, schools were held accountable for meeting adequate yearly progress (AYP) goals, and consequences were imposed for schools that failed to make progress. The law aimed to close achievement gaps, increase academic proficiency, and ensure that all students had access to a high-quality education.</p>
						<p>However, it is important to note that NCLB received criticism for its heavy emphasis on high-stakes testing, narrowing curriculum, and punitive measures for struggling schools. As a result, it was replaced by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015.</p>
						<h3>6. Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)</h3>
						<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Student_Succeeds_Act" target="_blank">Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)</a> is the current federal education law in the United States, replacing NCLB. ESSA provides states with greater flexibility and control over their education systems while still maintaining a focus on accountability, equity, and ensuring that all students have access to a quality education.</p>
						<p>Under ESSA, states develop their own accountability systems, which include measures of student academic achievement, school quality, and student success indicators. It encourages a more comprehensive approach to assessing school performance and supports the use of multiple measures beyond just test scores. ESSA also places a stronger emphasis on personalized learning, student support services, and the needs of English language learners and students with disabilities.</p>
						<p>ESSA continues to require schools to address achievement gaps and provide targeted support to low-performing schools. It promotes evidence-based interventions, encourages family and community engagement, and maintains the federal commitment to providing equitable educational opportunities for all students.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These federal laws, along with their subsequent amendments and court interpretations, provide the legal framework for special education services in the United States. They aim to ensure that students with disabilities have equal educational opportunities and access to the necessary supports to reach their full potential.</p>
